    <h1>Read-Only Text: How to Write Every Day</h1>

    <hr><small>
        Posted: <time class="published" datetime="2013-06-08T20:21:09">2013-06-08 20:21</time></small>
    <hr><p>In the canon of advice on writing, there's one thing that stands out: if you want to be a writer, you should write every day.</p>
<p>I uncovered something surprising: <strong>writing every day is *easier* than writing only when you feel inspired</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-illusion-of-big-changes">
<h2>The illusion of "big" changes</h2>
<p>Small steps lead to big changes.</p>
<p>Starting small is counterintuitive. Small steps don't lead to quick and dramatic results, and they seem more difficult. (I realize that my writing this post in one fell swoop is rather hypocritical.)</p>
<p>This might explain why dieting remains popular, even though <a class="reference external" href="http://magazine.ucla.edu/exclusives/dieting_no-go/">diets are ineffective</a>. Although people usually lose 5-10% of their weight during a diet, the majority regain that weight and more within four or five years after going off the diet.</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight and keep it off, you shouldn't go on an extreme diet that, say, prevents you from eating carbs for six months (a massive step). Instead, you should make minor but permanent alterations to the way you eat (small steps).</p>
<p>In writing, the equivalent of a diet is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>. Some people have enough drive to hit the 50,000-word mark, but most do not; only <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lettersandlight.org/post/13851021182/nanowrimos-gasp-inducing-2011-stats">14 percent of participants finished their novels in the 2011 challenge</a>. Why? I'd venture that the other 86 percent did not form a consistent writing habit during that month. They might have only written their novels when they felt "inspired."</p>
<p>For most of my life, I relied on the call of inspiration to direct my writing as well. Sometimes it felt like a superpower, driving me through entire chapters in a single day. But most of the time, that "inspired" feeling was an illusion. I'd wind up staring at an empty Word document <a class="footnote-reference" href="read-only-text-how-to-write-every-day.html#id2" id="id1">[*]</a> for hours. Write every day? Please. I couldn't even count on myself to write every <em>month</em>.</p>
<p>From these sporadic writing habits, it's easy to conclude that I didn't actually like writing. And I didn't. I dreaded doing it, and I flat-out hated it when the words didn't flow. Despite this, my identity was wrapped up in writing. From middle school through college, I always had five to twenty stories in progress. I thought about writing all the time. I felt guilty for not writing all the time. I believed that I was put on Earth to write and that I couldn't possibly become anything but a writer--this, even while I studied architecture in college. "I don't <em>want</em> to be a writer," I would tell people, in my pretentious manner, "I <em>am</em> a writer."</p>
<p>None of this is true anymore.</p>
<p>So what happened? <strong>First</strong>, I stopped taking myself so seriously. I took an extended break from writing, finally forgave myself for taking that break, and developed a growth-oriented mindset. (More on this later.) <strong>Second</strong>, I learned the difference between <em>being</em> and <em>doing</em>. Instead of being a writer because I thought of myself as a writer, I am now a writer because I do plenty of writing. <strong>Third</strong>--and this is what I'm going to share with you--I learned how to create good habits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-writing-habit">
<h2>Creating a writing habit</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, I stopped writing for a while, a little over half a year. It came to the point where I didn't even know whether I could still write a story. I reread the stories I'd written in college for my minor, the novel I finished at the end of high school, and the unfinished 60,000-word monster I'd barely touched since 2011; they all seemed like foreign artifacts, products of a different brain. In high school, I worried that I would someday plateau in my writing. If you'd asked me back in January of this year, I would have told you that the day had come.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter anymore. I'd finally shed that awful "writer" identity. If I ever wanted to pick up writing again, I could, but I didn't have to. If I failed, so be it. The catch: I'd have to do it slowly.</p>
<p>Johnny Dale's guide <a class="reference external" href="http://abuckfifty.tumblr.com/">It's Not a Sprint, It's a Marathon</a> outlines a four-week plan of small steps to build the habit of writing every day: write 150 words every day during the first week, 200 during the second, and so on. This is a smart guide, and it would probably work for most people, but even 150 words proved to be too much for me.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago--May 19--I decided to start with <strong>a sentence a day</strong>. I liked this idea because of the fluidity of sentences: they can consist of one word ("Go!") to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_English_sentence">thousands of words</a>.</p>
<p>So, I went ahead and wrote a sentence every day that week. It was difficult to stick to that one sentence, at first because I couldn't remember what my story was about, and later because I enjoyed writing so much that I wanted to do more than one sentence. But I enforced the one-sentence rule as both a minimum and a maximum. I didn't want to burn out. As a consequence, I packed as much as possible within the limit, churning out ridiculously long (30+ words) sentences.</p>
<p>The next week, I upped the game to two sentences. Halfway through that week, I gave myself permission to treat the two-sentence rule as a minimum. This week, I'm doing three. At this rate, I should have written a total of 42 sentences so far.</p>
<p>Instead, I ended up writing 7,056 words, which, at an average sentence length of 15 words, comes out to <strong>470 sentences, over ten times more than I expected</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm certain that number will increase exponentially for a few more weeks and then reach an equilibrium. I look forward to finding out my ideal minimum sentence count: perhaps ten?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="three-rules-for-writing-every-day">
<h2>Three rules for writing every day</h2>
<p>Everyone writes differently, and I'm not an expert by any means. But if you're struggling with writing every day, these "rules" might be useful to you. I recommend starting your habit on a Sunday, because then it's easy to figure out when you need to add a sentence: new week, add one.</p>
<div class="section" id="write-a-sentence-every-day">
<h3>#1: <strong>Write a sentence every day.</strong></h3>
<p>The sentence can take any shape and contain any number of words. It doesn't even have to be grammatically correct. In seven days, up your daily number of sentences by one. Repeat for each week that passes. When you've found your ideal number of daily sentences, stop adding to it, and use that number as your permanent minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> This rule helps you to build a writing habit, however small, into your daily schedule. The key is that you don't skip any days. Skipping even one day makes it easier to skip the next. As time passes, you'll find that writing every day is easier than writing every once in a while, because you're constantly exercising that part of your brain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-not-edit-sentences-from-previous-days-until-you-have-finished-the-entire-story">
<h3>#2: <strong>Do not edit sentences from previous days until you have finished the entire story.</strong></h3>
<p>This is extremely important. Unless you're Thomas Pynchon, you will write terrible sentences. And it's okay. That doesn't mean you're a terrible writer--it's just a natural consequence of writing so frequently. Some days your output will be brilliant. Some days you'll look at what you wrote before and want to kill it with fire. But you <strong>must not backspace on your previous day's sentences</strong>.</p>
<p>You're more than welcome to edit what you've written today. However, when 24 hours is up, so is your editing access to those sentences. I like to think of work from previous days as being <strong>read-only</strong>. You can read all you like, but you can't overwrite. (If you have a strong tendency toward line-editing, you could write your sentences in separate files and actually mark them as read-only when you're done. But only do this if you don't mind dealing with thousands of files for one story.)</p>
<p>Let's say you've written a bunch of sentences in the past few days that don't fit with your new vision of the story. What do you do? Forget about them! Go forth and write new sentences that do fit with your vision. You can align them when you're done with the entire story.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> One of the fastest ways to kill your writing habit is to get caught in a line-edit loop. I had this problem for many years. I would write something, hate it, and rewrite it ad nauseum until it was "perfect." I believed I couldn't finish my stories because I "didn't have time." In reality, I couldn't finish my stories because I kept destroying my ideas right after creating them. (For more on this topic, read Scott H. Young's excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/01/07/how-to-fuel-a-creative-flow/">How to Fuel a Creative Flow</a>.)</p>
<p>This rule helps you to reach the finish line. In your first draft, quantity matters more than quality. It doesn't matter how bad your sentences are to start with; as long as you've written them down, you can improve them later. When you've finished an entire draft--and <em>only</em> when you've finished an entire draft--you can edit to your heart's desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-your-new-sentences-to-the-end-of-where-you-left-off-the-previous-day">
<h3>#3: <strong>Add your new sentences to the end of where you left off the previous day.</strong></h3>
<p>In other words, your scenes are read-only, too. You can't write a new sentence in the middle of a paragraph from a previous day. If you choose to do this anyway, then that sentence doesn't count.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Rule #2 prevents destructive editing; this rule prevents <em>constructive</em> editing. It ensures that each new sentence is subsequent, which increases the likelihood that the new sentence will push the story forward.</p>
<p>That's it. Follow these rules, and you're set for a brand-new writing habit!</p>

<h2>Making writing easier</h2>
<p>Writing is immensely difficult. Anyone who says otherwise most likely isn't doing it correctly. But the tools you choose can make it a little less painful. Here's what I'm using.</p>
<div class="section" id="evernote-premium">
<h3>Evernote Premium</h3>
<p>When I started my habit, I wrote the first sentence on my computer, in pluma (MATE's fork of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit">gedit</a>). Since then I've written everything else in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>. I pay for Evernote, so it does automatic version control on my notes. For now, this is a good solution for me. Maybe some day I'll figure out how to edit files remotely in Emacs and host them on Bitbucket.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-old-but-still-very-smart-phone">
<h3>One old, but still very smart, phone</h3>
<p>This is pretty much blasphemy, but I'm writing my novel on my phone. I do this for two main reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple"><li>At work, I sit in front of a computer all day. I usually can't bear to turn on my personal computer when I get home. On the other hand, my phone is always on, and I take it almost everywhere. It's incredibly easy to fire up the Evernote app and start thumbing away, whether at home or on the go.</li>
<li>My computer is a lovely, new piece of equipment that can run multiple programs side by side. My phone, while also lovely, is ancient for a smartphone (3.5 years, one of the five oldest Android models). It takes a while to open and switch apps, so when I get into editing mode in the Evernote app, I stay in editing mode. It's the perfect modern typewriter! I need <a class="reference external" href="http://pyroom.org/">PyRoom</a> on my computer to even come close to mimicking the immersive, full-screen writing experience caused by the technological limitations of my phone.</li>
