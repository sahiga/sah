w3m
=== 

w3m is a text-based web browser, first released in 1995.

- "Opening socket"

- Viewing[SSL]

- shows you the names of cookies you're receiving

- lowercase "v" shows HTML source of webpage

What I like about w3m:

- No ads
- Consistent, uniform fonts and colors. 

What I don't like:

- No omnibox: Pressing **Shift + U** gets you into the address bar, but, obviously, you can't type in a search term and have it redirect to a DuckDuckGo (Google, Bing, etc.) search for that term.

TextOnly
========

Now, I could **really** use something like w3m on my phone[*]. The closest I could find is `TextOnly <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spacenext.textonly>`_, a text-based web browser for Android 1.6+.

Unfortunately, w3m it's not. The interface is befuddling. It offers three different options for viewing a page: RSS Feed, Links, and Normal. I prefer the "Normal" dislay to the other two.

[*] My phone is an HTC Droid Eris, `one of the first ten Android phones released and one of the first two Android phones released by Verizon <http://www.androidphonesarena.com/2009-android-phones.php>`, along with the Motorola Droid. It does wonderfully for a 3.5-year old phone, but it chokes on resource-heavy websites. 
`Dolphin <http://www.dolphin-browser.com>`_ is a beautiful and intuitive browser
