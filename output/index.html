        <h1><a href="posts/read-only-text-how-to-write-every-day.html">Read-Only Text: How to Write Every Day</a>
        <small>  
             Posted: <time class="published" datetime="2013-06-08T20:21:09">2013-06-08 20:21</time></small></h1>
        <hr><p>In the canon of advice on writing, there's one thing that stands out: if you want to be a writer, you should write every day.</p>
<p>I uncovered something surprising: <strong>writing every day is *easier* than writing only when you feel inspired</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-illusion-of-big-changes">
<h2>The illusion of "big" changes</h2>
<p>Small steps lead to big changes.</p>
<p>Starting small is counterintuitive. Small steps don't lead to quick and dramatic results, and they seem more difficult. (I realize that my writing this post in one fell swoop is rather hypocritical.)</p>
<p>This might explain why dieting remains popular, even though <a class="reference external" href="http://magazine.ucla.edu/exclusives/dieting_no-go/">diets are ineffective</a>. Although people usually lose 5-10% of their weight during a diet, the majority regain that weight and more within four or five years after going off the diet.</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight and keep it off, you shouldn't go on an extreme diet that, say, prevents you from eating carbs for six months (a massive step). Instead, you should make minor but permanent alterations to the way you eat (small steps).</p>
<p>In writing, the equivalent of a diet is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>. Some people have enough drive to hit the 50,000-word mark, but most do not; only <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.lettersandlight.org/post/13851021182/nanowrimos-gasp-inducing-2011-stats">14 percent of participants finished their novels in the 2011 challenge</a>. Why? I'd venture that the other 86 percent did not form a consistent writing habit during that month. They might have only written their novels when they felt "inspired."</p>
<p>For most of my life, I relied on the call of inspiration to direct my writing as well. Sometimes it felt like a superpower, driving me through entire chapters in a single day. But most of the time, that "inspired" feeling was an illusion. I'd wind up staring at an empty Word document <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/read-only-text-how-to-write-every-day.html#id2" id="id1">[*]</a> for hours. Write every day? Please. I couldn't even count on myself to write every <em>month</em>.</p>
<p>From these sporadic writing habits, it's easy to conclude that I didn't actually like writing. And I didn't. I dreaded doing it, and I flat-out hated it when the words didn't flow. Despite this, my identity was wrapped up in writing. From middle school through college, I always had five to twenty stories in progress. I thought about writing all the time. I felt guilty for not writing all the time. I believed that I was put on Earth to write and that I couldn't possibly become anything but a writer--this, even while I studied architecture in college. "I don't <em>want</em> to be a writer," I would tell people, in my pretentious manner, "I <em>am</em> a writer."</p>
<p>None of this is true anymore.</p>
<p>So what happened? <strong>First</strong>, I stopped taking myself so seriously. I took an extended break from writing, finally forgave myself for taking that break, and developed a growth-oriented mindset. (More on this later.) <strong>Second</strong>, I learned the difference between <em>being</em> and <em>doing</em>. Instead of being a writer because I thought of myself as a writer, I am now a writer because I do plenty of writing. <strong>Third</strong>--and this is what I'm going to share with you--I learned how to create good habits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-writing-habit">
<h2>Creating a writing habit</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, I stopped writing for a while, a little over half a year. It came to the point where I didn't even know whether I could still write a story. I reread the stories I'd written in college for my minor, the novel I finished at the end of high school, and the unfinished 60,000-word monster I'd barely touched since 2011; they all seemed like foreign artifacts, products of a different brain. In high school, I worried that I would someday plateau in my writing. If you'd asked me back in January of this year, I would have told you that the day had come.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter anymore. I'd finally shed that awful "writer" identity. If I ever wanted to pick up writing again, I could, but I didn't have to. If I failed, so be it. The catch: I'd have to do it slowly.</p>
<p>Johnny Dale's guide <a class="reference external" href="http://abuckfifty.tumblr.com/">It's Not a Sprint, It's a Marathon</a> outlines a four-week plan of small steps to build the habit of writing every day: write 150 words every day during the first week, 200 during the second, and so on. This is a smart guide, and it would probably work for most people, but even 150 words proved to be too much for me.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago--May 19--I decided to start with <strong>a sentence a day</strong>. I liked this idea because of the fluidity of sentences: they can consist of one word ("Go!") to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_English_sentence">thousands of words</a>.</p>
<p>So, I went ahead and wrote a sentence every day that week. It was difficult to stick to that one sentence, at first because I couldn't remember what my story was about, and later because I enjoyed writing so much that I wanted to do more than one sentence. But I enforced the one-sentence rule as both a minimum and a maximum. I didn't want to burn out. As a consequence, I packed as much as possible within the limit, churning out ridiculously long (30+ words) sentences.</p>
<p>The next week, I upped the game to two sentences. Halfway through that week, I gave myself permission to treat the two-sentence rule as a minimum. This week, I'm doing three. At this rate, I should have written a total of 42 sentences so far.</p>
<p>Instead, I ended up writing 7,056 words, which, at an average sentence length of 15 words, comes out to <strong>470 sentences, over ten times more than I expected</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm certain that number will increase exponentially for a few more weeks and then reach an equilibrium. I look forward to finding out my ideal minimum sentence count: perhaps ten?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="three-rules-for-writing-every-day">
<h2>Three rules for writing every day</h2>
<p>Everyone writes differently, and I'm not an expert by any means. But if you're struggling with writing every day, these "rules" might be useful to you. I recommend starting your habit on a Sunday, because then it's easy to figure out when you need to add a sentence: new week, add one.</p>
<div class="section" id="write-a-sentence-every-day">
<h3>#1: <strong>Write a sentence every day.</strong></h3>
<p>The sentence can take any shape and contain any number of words. It doesn't even have to be grammatically correct. In seven days, up your daily number of sentences by one. Repeat for each week that passes. When you've found your ideal number of daily sentences, stop adding to it, and use that number as your permanent minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> This rule helps you to build a writing habit, however small, into your daily schedule. The key is that you don't skip any days. Skipping even one day makes it easier to skip the next. As time passes, you'll find that writing every day is easier than writing every once in a while, because you're constantly exercising that part of your brain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-not-edit-sentences-from-previous-days-until-you-have-finished-the-entire-story">
<h3>#2: <strong>Do not edit sentences from previous days until you have finished the entire story.</strong></h3>
<p>This is extremely important. Unless you're Thomas Pynchon, you will write terrible sentences. And it's okay. That doesn't mean you're a terrible writer--it's just a natural consequence of writing so frequently. Some days your output will be brilliant. Some days you'll look at what you wrote before and want to kill it with fire. But you <strong>must not backspace on your previous day's sentences</strong>.</p>
<p>You're more than welcome to edit what you've written today. However, when 24 hours is up, so is your editing access to those sentences. I like to think of work from previous days as being <strong>read-only</strong>. You can read all you like, but you can't overwrite. (If you have a strong tendency toward line-editing, you could write your sentences in separate files and actually mark them as read-only when you're done. But only do this if you don't mind dealing with thousands of files for one story.)</p>
<p>Let's say you've written a bunch of sentences in the past few days that don't fit with your new vision of the story. What do you do? Forget about them! Go forth and write new sentences that do fit with your vision. You can align them when you're done with the entire story.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> One of the fastest ways to kill your writing habit is to get caught in a line-edit loop. I had this problem for many years. I would write something, hate it, and rewrite it ad nauseum until it was "perfect." I believed I couldn't finish my stories because I "didn't have time." In reality, I couldn't finish my stories because I kept destroying my ideas right after creating them. (For more on this topic, read Scott H. Young's excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/01/07/how-to-fuel-a-creative-flow/">How to Fuel a Creative Flow</a>.)</p>
<p>This rule helps you to reach the finish line. In your first draft, quantity matters more than quality. It doesn't matter how bad your sentences are to start with; as long as you've written them down, you can improve them later. When you've finished an entire draft--and <em>only</em> when you've finished an entire draft--you can edit to your heart's desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-your-new-sentences-to-the-end-of-where-you-left-off-the-previous-day">
<h3>#3: <strong>Add your new sentences to the end of where you left off the previous day.</strong></h3>
<p>In other words, your scenes are read-only, too. You can't write a new sentence in the middle of a paragraph from a previous day. If you choose to do this anyway, then that sentence doesn't count.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Rule #2 prevents destructive editing; this rule prevents <em>constructive</em> editing. It ensures that each new sentence is subsequent, which increases the likelihood that the new sentence will push the story forward.</p>
<p>That's it. Follow these rules, and you're set for a brand-new writing habit!</p>

<div class="section" id="making-writing-easier">
<h2>Making writing easier</h2>
<p>Writing is immensely difficult. Anyone who says otherwise most likely isn't doing it correctly. But the tools you choose can make it a little less painful. Here's what I'm using.</p>
<div class="section" id="evernote-premium">
<h3>Evernote Premium</h3>
<p>When I started my habit, I wrote the first sentence on my computer, in pluma (MATE's fork of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit">gedit</a>). Since then I've written everything else in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>. I pay for Evernote, so it does automatic version control on my notes. For now, this is a good solution for me. Maybe some day I'll figure out how to edit files remotely in Emacs and host them on Bitbucket.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-old-but-still-very-smart-phone">
<h3>One old, but still very smart, phone</h3>
<p>This is pretty much blasphemy, but I'm writing my novel on my phone. I do this for two main reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple"><li>At work, I sit in front of a computer all day. I usually can't bear to turn on my personal computer when I get home. On the other hand, my phone is always on, and I take it almost everywhere. It's incredibly easy to fire up the Evernote app and start thumbing away, whether at home or on the go.</li>
<li>My computer is a lovely, new piece of equipment that can run multiple programs side by side. My phone, while also lovely, is ancient for a smartphone (3.5 years, one of the five oldest Android models). It takes a while to open and switch apps, so when I get into editing mode in the Evernote app, I stay in editing mode. It's the perfect modern typewriter! I need <a class="reference external" href="http://pyroom.org/">PyRoom</a> on my computer to even come close to mimicking the immersive, full-screen writing experience caused by the technological limitations of my phone.</li>

             Posted: <time class="published" datetime="2013-05-18T18:32:32">2013-05-18 18:32</time></small></h1>
        <hr><p>On Friday, my company held a personal project hack day. I used the opportunity to run a quick-and-dirty experiment based on a question I've had on my mind for months: <strong>What's the most beloved car brand in hip-hop?</strong></p>
<p>What follows is an excessively detailed replay of the entire experiment. <a class="reference external" href="http://stephaniehiga.com/cars.html#results">Click here to skip the boring stuff and go straight to the results.</a></p>
<div class="section" id="why-hip-hop">
<h2>Why hip-hop?</h2>
<p>Hip-hop is by far my favorite genre of music. I don't listen to much else. On the road, I tune the radio to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.935kday.com/">93.5 KDAY</a>; otherwise, I'm plugged into my Pandora account, which is heavy on Golden Age, Midwestern, East Coast, Bay Area, and (recently) indie rap. Someday I'll give podcasts/NPR/classical music a whirl. But that someday is a long while away.</p>
<p>Hip-hop is also lyrically dense, which makes it a great source for a text mining project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-car-brands">
<h2>Why car brands?</h2>
<p>Rappers talk about cars. A lot. So I decided to find out once and for all which brand they love the most, with <strong>Chevy</strong> as my hypothesis. Maybe it's because of my fondness for Chevy trucks, but it seems like Chevy pops up in every other song I hear these days.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mining-hip-hop-lyrics">
<h2>Mining hip-hop lyrics</h2>
<p>To find the answer, I needed a sizeable sample of car brand names, a searchable database of hip-hop lyrics, a script to search for the brands within the lyrics database, and a way of displaying the results. Fortunately, all the necessary tools were readily available:</p>
<ul class="simple"><li>Python</li>
<li>Wikipedia</li>
<li>LibreOffice Calc</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://research.blackyouthproject.com/raplyrics/">Rap Lyrics Database</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a></li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul><div class="section" id="gathering-the-data">
<h3>Gathering the data</h3>
<p>Wikipedia blocks web scrapers, understandably. So I manually downloaded all of Wikipedia's lists of car manufacturers and brands by country. To reduce the amount of HTML I would have to parse, I selected the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Mobile View</a> for each page.</p>
<p>I downloaded ten files in total: a general list of car manufacturers plus individual lists for China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cleaning-the-data">
<h3>Cleaning the data</h3>
<p>Wikipedia's Mobile View pages contain search bars at the top and the usual "See also," "References," and "Read in another language" links. I started by erasing these (manually again), reducing the files to structural markup and the lists themselves.</p>
<p>With the Python <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> library, I extracted the brand name tags by selecting all list elements. Then I used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org">NLTK</a> to remove the HTML tags and regular expressions to remove excess whitespace and text (such as notes about the brand, the brand's years of operation, etc.). This is what I came up with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def clean_wikilist(filename):
    # open saved html file
    html = open(filename).read()

    # collect bulleted items only
    bullets = SoupStrainer("li")

    # make soup out of the bulleted items
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml', parse_only = bullets).prettify()

    # remove html from soup
    raw = nltk.clean_html(soup)

    # remove extra lines
    raw = re.sub(r'\n \n \n \n \n', r'\n', raw)
    raw = re.sub(r'\n \n \n', r'\n', raw)

    # create and clean tokens
    tokens = raw.split('\n')
    tokens = [re.sub(r'^\s+(?=[\S]+)', r'', token) for token in tokens]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if not re.findall(r'\[[0-9]+\]|\([\S\s]+[\(\)]?|^\s+$|^[\s\[\]\(\)0-9]+$', token)]
    tokens = list(set(tokens))

    return tokens
</pre>
<p>After running my script on all ten lists, I had a whopping <strong>2599 brand names</strong>. So I decided to limit the set to Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US. The pages for Germany, the UK, and the US separate current brands from defunct brands, so for those countries I used current brands only. The Japan page mixes current and defunct brands into one list; to save time, I used all of them.</p>
<p>These four pages have slightly different structures. The <tt class="docutils literal">clean_wikilist()</tt> script worked nicely for Japan, but captured too much information on the others, so I wrote three additional scripts. Here's the one for Germany:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def autos_ge():
        # open saved html file
        html = open('autos-ge.html').read()

        # create soup object
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html)

        # select current major manufacturers
        majors = soup.select('span.mw-headline')
        majors = [w for w in majors if w.parent.parent.previous_sibling.contents[0]['id'] == 'Current_major_manufacturers']
        major_tokens = [nltk.clean_html(str(w)) for w in majors]
        major_tokens = [re.sub(r'\[\s\S\s\]', r'', token) for token in major_tokens]

        # select current minor manufacturers
        minors = soup.select('li')
        minors = [w for w in minors if w.parent.parent.previous_sibling.contents[0]['id'] == 'Current_minor_manufacturers']
        minor_tokens = [nltk.clean_html(str(w)) for w in minors]
        minor_tokens = [re.sub(r'\s\(\S+\)', r'', token) for token in minor_tokens]

        # combine lists
        tokens = list(set(minor_tokens + major_tokens))

        return tokens
</pre>
<p>One notable difference between this and the original script is the usage of Beautiful Soup. In <tt class="docutils literal">clean_wikilist()</tt>, the desired elements are selected first, with SoupStrainer, and then used to create a list of the matching HTML tags in unicode format. <tt class="docutils literal">autos_ge()</tt>, on the other hand, creates a Beautiful Soup object out of the entire page; the desired elements are selected via DOM traversal.</p>
<p>The number of brand names from this limited dataset? Just 178.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analyzing-the-data">
<h3>Analyzing the data</h3>
<p>The Rap Lyrics Database contains lyrics for all of Billboard Music's rap songs from 1989 through 2009. It's the only searchable database of hip-hop lyrics (exclusively).</p>
<p>The result pages share the same URL, with the search term appended to the end: <em>http://research.blackyouthproject.com/raplyrics/results/?all/1989-2009/</em>. This made it much easier to automate the search and saving process.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def rap_search(auto_list):
    # search for each brand name
    for brand in auto_list:
        url = 'http://research.blackyouthproject.com/raplyrics/results/?all/1989-2009/' + word

        # save the search results page
        results_html = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()

        # save it as a file named after the brand
        results = word + '.html'

        with open(results, 'w') as results_file:
            results_file.write(results_html)
</pre>
<p>This saved 178 HTML pages, each named after the appropriate brand search term, onto my computer. I also searched for known nicknames of the brands (e.g., "Bimmer/Beemer/Beamer" for BMW and "Chevy" for Chevrolet).</p>
<p>I used Beautiful Soup again to count the number of results on each page:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def count_rap_results():
        # for all html files in current directory
        for filename in os.listdir('.'):
        if filename.endswith('html'):

        # select song titles
        html = open(filename).read()
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
        songs = soup.select('.title')

        # count number of song titles
        count = len(songs)

        # write brand names and number of songs into a text file
        with open('count_rap_autos.txt', 'a') as counter_file:
                counter_file.write('%s%15d\n' % (filename[:-5], count))
</pre>
<p>This got me a pretty messy-looking text file of each brand and the number of songs in which it was mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lea-Francis               1</p>
<p>Ewing      0</p>
<p>Efini         0</p>
<p>Scion       0</p>
<p>Tommy Kaira            15</p>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turned out that the Rap Lyrics Database doesn't recognize spaces. So, a search for "Art and Tech" became a search for "Art"--which of course is a popular word that is often used in a non-automobile context. I removed ambiguous names from the list and combined the results from brands and their nicknames. LibreOffice Calc was helpful in fixing the columns and sorting the results.</p>
<p>The final number of usable brands came out to 153.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-won">
<h2>Who won?</h2>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong>, with <strong>93 song mentions</strong>--and remember, that's only counting a small segment of rap songs between 1989-2009.</p>
<p>Jeep came in second, at 34 songs. Then came Cadillac with 25 songs, and finally Chevy at 24.</p>
<p>So, Chevy isn't as popular as I expected. But the biggest shocker is Jeep. I can't recall a single song that mentions Jeep.</p>
<p>To display the results, I made a <a class="reference external" href="http://stephaniehiga.com/cars.html#results">graph</a> with Google Charts. (I'd add them here, but I've yet to learn how to embed JavaScript into reStructuredText.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pain-points">
<h2>Pain points</h2>
<p>I'm new to programming. While I enjoy it very much, I spend about 90% of my time immersed in pain. The text analysis took me four nights (Monday through Thursday) to complete. On the actual hack day, I made the graph and web page, with a lot of help from Bootstrap. Along the way, I encountered many problems:</p>
<ul><li><p class="first">Selecting specific subsets of HTML tags with no classes or ids.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Accidentally passing list items with the newline character to the <tt class="docutils literal">rap_search()</tt> script, resulting in 178 filenames split off from their extensions. Fortunately there was an easy fix:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for filename in os.listdir("."):
        if '\n' in filename:
        os.rename(filename, re.sub(r'\n', r'', filename))

<h2>Notes for the future</h2>
<div class="section" id="more-complete-data">
<h3>More complete data</h3>
<p>I slashed the set of brand names to less than 7% of its original size and conflated "car manufacturers" with "car brands." Wikipedia also has a lengthy <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobile_marques">list of automobile marques</a>, which I didn't even touch.</p>
<p>I'd like to go deeper than brands, into the actual names of cars, and match them against an even bigger database of lyrics. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rapgenius.com">RapGenius</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm API</a> are possible alternatives to the Rap Lyrics Database. RapGenius has an excellent database, but it contains a significant amount of lyrics from non-hip-hop artists as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="semantic-orientation">
<h3>Semantic orientation</h3>
<p>I equated "beloved" to "number of songs mentions." This is obviously not always the case, as rappers name-drop plenty of things they dislike. It's true that rappers generally mention cars in a positive manner, but a more accurate experiment would take into account not just how many times the brand was used, but in what way the brand was used--i.e., the semantic orientation of the brand. A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a> might be the way to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-word-brands">
<h3>Multi-word brands</h3>
<p>The Rap Lyrics Database turns up blank if you search for, say "Aston Martin" (with the quotes and the space), even though Aston Martin is mentioned in a few songs. So multi-word brands with spaces in them turned up short. (Mercedes-Benz doesn't have this issue because it has a hyphen, not a space.)</p>
<p>If I were to use the Rap Lyrics Database again, I'd have to search for "Aston" and "Martin" separately and compare the songs on each results page. Otherwise, RapGenius seems to do spaces nicely.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nicknames-and-duplicates">
<h3>Nicknames and duplicates</h3>
<p>I searched for "Mercedes-Benz" as well as just "Mercedes" and "Benz." However, again, because I didn't compare song names, I ended up nixing the counts for the nicknames to minimize the possibility of duplicates. I also missed some nicknames--for instance, I completely neglected "Caddy" and "Lac" (sorry, Cadillac), "Lex," etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="misspellings-plurals-etc">
<h3>Misspellings, plurals, etc.</h3>
<p>I did search for "Beamer" and "Beemer," but there's also "Bima" and probably countless other misspellings of "Bimmer" and other car brands. I ignored plurals, whether spelled correctly ("Bimmers") or not ("Bimaz").</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disambiguation">
<h3>Disambiguation</h3>
<p>Many car brands double as common words or unrelated proper names, e.g., Prince, Radical, Ram, MINI, Oakland. I discarded these instead of determining whether or not they were referring to the car brand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="last-thoughts">
<h3>Last thoughts</h3>
<p>A few months ago, when I first got the idea for this project, I thought it would be ridiculously hard. I envisioned building a large corpus of hip-hop lyrics and determining the classification, meaning, and orientation of each word to uncover the truth.</p>
<p>After going about this somewhat backwards, I think my initial impression remains correct. I'm happy I finally took a stab at the project, and I'm excited to continue working on it. This is just the first of a long series of experiments (and blog posts)!</p>

        <hr><p>Version control terrifies me.</p>
<p>But you know what else terrifies me? Losing files. I've lost enough of them and endured enough filename headaches (story-1.doc, story-2.doc, story-final, story-new.doc, story-newEST.doc, etc.) in my lifetime to realize that <strong>version control is extremely important</strong>, and I need to develop better version control habits.</p>
<p>So, I added the files for this site to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sahiga/sah">my GitHub account</a>. The following guide details the steps I took, minus the legion of errors I made. I've named it "GitHub for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxmint.com">Linux Mint</a>," in honor of my operating system and the fact that GitHub offers <a class="reference external" href="http://mac.github.com">GitHub for Mac</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://windows.github.com">GitHub for Windows</a>, but no GitHub for GNU/Linux (even though, hey, some of us GNU/Linux users could use a little point-and-click help over here).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Afterward, I realized I could have had a <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote">much easier time</a> cloning the repository. This command is identical to the "Clone in Windows" and "Clone in Mac" buttons in the corresponding GitHub GUI applications:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone &lt;URL&gt;
</pre>

<div class="section" id="connect-your-computer-to-github">
<h2>Connect your computer to GitHub</h2>
<p>First, you need a secure method of connecting your computer to GitHub. You can do this through SSH (generate a new public/private SSH key pair and add it to your GitHub account) or through HTTPS (configure the Git credential helper).</p>

<p>Fire up your command line. Move to the directory containing your version control files (if you're not there already), e.g., <tt class="docutils literal">cd sah</tt>.</p>
<p>Initialize a Git repository in this directory. This is the <strong>local branch</strong>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>Check the status of your new repository.</p>

<p>(or <tt class="docutils literal">git st</tt> if you've set up <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book/ch2-7.html#Git-Aliases">aliases</a>). This is optional, but I like checking the status to see which branch I'm working on and which files will be included in the next commit.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>
<p>Right now there's "nothing added to commit," meaning the local repository is empty. This is because you've just initialized it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="start-tracking-your-files">
<h2>Start tracking your files</h2>
<p>Next, add version control tracking to your files. To add individual files, write <tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt> and then the filename. To add everything in the directory to your commit:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git add .
</pre>
<p>Now it's time to commit the change. The basic commit command is <tt class="docutils literal">git commit</tt>, which will launch your preferred text editor. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></tt> flag allows you to skip the text editor and type your commit message inline; the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></tt> flag tells Git to automatically stage your tracked files, skipping the staging area.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git commit -a -m "Added Nikola site files"
</pre>

</div>
<div class="section" id="merge-and-sync-your-branches">
<h2>Merge and sync your branches</h2>
<p>Merge the remote branch (the GitHub copy of the repository) with your local branch (the local copy of the repository). This consolidates the two branches and ensures that they are identical.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git pull https://github.com/sahiga/sah.git
</pre>
<p>You should see a message like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

**Note:** ``git pull`` automatically merges commits from the "pulled" branch into your current branch. This works fine on an empty GitHub repository, but it could cause `merge conflicts &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote&gt;`_.
</pre>
<p>Push your commit on the local branch to the remote branch:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git push origin master
</pre>
<p>If you're using HTTPS, GitHub will prompt you for credentials. To switch to SSH, <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/why-is-git-always-asking-for-my-password">follow these instructions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong> I originally attempted <tt class="docutils literal">git push origin master</tt> before <tt class="docutils literal">git pull</tt>, resulting in a "non-fast-forward" error. This error occurs when the local branch is behind the remote branch, and therefore Git can't push the local commits without losing commits on the remote branch. GitHub has an <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-non-fast-forward-errors">article on non-fast-forward errors</a> that I wish I'd found when I made this mistake.</blockquote>
<p>The two branches are now in sync! Check the commit history in your local branch with <tt class="docutils literal">git log</tt>. The most recent commit should have a "Merge" attribute, identical to what you'll find in the "Commits" tab in your GitHub account:</p>

        <hr><p>It's official: I've finally migrated my personal website from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar">Nikola</a>, a static site generator. In my 53432099809th attempt to return to writing, I'll use this bit of nerd news to jumpstart what I hope will become a regular blogging habit.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-quest-for-static">
<h2>The quest for static</h2>
<p>WordPress gets a lot of hate in the development community. Let me say upfront that this is absolutely not the reason I decided to leave it (I have the softest of spots for WordPress). It's just that one day I woke up and realized I didn't need a database and a gazillion server queries to post text on my website.</p>
<p>So I started looking into static site generators. A static site generator does exactly what's written on the box: it creates a static site. It combines the best of Web 1.0 (fast, portable, secure HTML pages) with the best of Web 2.0 (templates). I considered:</p>
<ul class="simple"><li><a class="reference external" href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> + <a class="reference external" href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a>: Hooks directly into <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and is apparently very good. But I don't know Ruby, so I kept looking.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>: A Python port of Jekyll. Ultimately, I passed on it because of the lack of documentation. When it comes to technology, this Luddite needs a lot of hand-holding.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com">Pelican</a>: Also Python-based, with complete, well-written documentation. I installed it and got lost while trying to generate files. Pelican looks like a great choice, but I think it's meant for people who are much more tech-savvy than I am.</li>
</ul><p>Shortly after I installed Pelican, someone posted a link to <a class="reference external" href="http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar">Nikola</a> on Hacker News. I'm not sure why it didn't come up in all my searches for Python-based static site generators, because so far it's proven to be a dream come true. The documentation is amazing. It's easy to use and in active development. And it was named after <a class="reference external" href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>. (<strong>Huge</strong> Nikola Tesla fan here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="goodbye-wordpress">
<h2>Goodbye, WordPress</h2>
<p>Nikola has an <tt class="docutils literal">import_wordpress</tt> function to ease the transition to WordPress. I grabbed an XML dump of my site (<strong>Tools &gt; Export &gt; All Content</strong> in the WP admin panel) and saved it in my Nikola site folder.</p>
<p>I installed the Python <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests">requests</a> package (import_wordpress depends on requests):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install requests
</pre>
<p>Then I ran import_wordpress on the file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
nikola import_wordpress stephanieahiga.wordpress.2013-05-05.xml
</pre>
<p>This created a new folder, <strong>new_site</strong>, within the Nikola folder. I had no posts and only a handful of pages in my WordPress database, so I recreated the pages manually using the page command: <tt class="docutils literal">nikola new_post <span class="pre">-p</span></tt>. Similar to WordPress, Nikola differentiates between posts and pages: posts are in the <strong>posts</strong> folder and pages are in the <strong>stories</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Finally, I uninstalled WordPress from my domain via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.simplescripts.com">SimpleScripts</a> on my cPanel.</p>
<p>import_wordpress saves all posts and pages with the <tt class="docutils literal">.wp</tt> extension (read by my computer as WordPerfect files). The XML dump, and therefore the folder created by import_wordpress, save the contents of the WordPress database, but <strong>not</strong> the theme files. So it's important to backup any custom themes before uninstalling WordPress.</p>
