      <div class="entry-content">
        <div>
<p>I'm going to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a> next week!</p>
<p>Hack Reactor is a programming bootcamp -- the most intense of its kind, at eleven hours a day, six days a week, for twelve weeks. Pretty much everyone I've mentioned it to has recoiled in horror, imagining what it would be like to spend so much time cooped up in front of a screen. Yeah, I know. It sounds terrible. It might even sound nonsensical. But here I am anyway: packing my bags, preparing to fly to San Francisco in a few days, and writing about the program that will take over my life for the next three months.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Last August I happened upon Smashing Magazine during work hours, likely in search of CSS help. I'm sure I found what I was looking for, but what caught my eye was an ad for Hack Reactor. Twelve-week immersive programming bootcamp! Six-figure average starting salary! It seemed too good to be true.</p>
<p>The only programming bootcamp I'd heard of was General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, which had briefly interested me until I lucked into a front-end development role at my company back in 2013. I'd even taken a couple of General Assembly classes -- Intro to Data Science and Analysis (at their Santa Monica campus) and Optimizing Landing Pages for Conversion (online) -- neither of which had impressed me.</p>
<p>But Hack Reactor looked like a completely different species of bootcamp. It looked like something I needed.</p>
<p>Many people have questioned why I would need a bootcamp when I already have a career in web development. So I feel compelled to explain my reasoning here.</p>
<p>I may not be a novice programmer, but I learned to code recently enough that I remember what it was like to be a novice programmer and how much I struggled to even get to that point. I'm a late bloomer: after years of grappling with for loops and other basic concepts, I finally managed to make sense of programming at the ripe old age of 23. (In fact, I was weeks, maybe even days, away from 24 at that point.) The book that did it for me is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/book/">Natural Language Processing with Python</a> -- a truly wonderful read, if you're more inclined to language than math, as I am.</p>
<p>Learning to code was a terrific, frustrating, enlightening experience. When I realized I could solve problems in Python, I was shocked. People had told me that it was impossible to learn to code after a certain age, that developers had an "innate ability" that I didn't have. (By the way, if anyone ever says such complete and utter bullshit to you, you must prove them wrong.)</p>
<p>Soon after I taught myself basic Python, I offered to build a WordPress theme for a project at work, through which I picked up jQuery and a tiny bit of PHP. Within half a year, the company decided to move me from the business team to the development team; from there, I learned a ton on the job and eventually served as the sole front-end developer and designer. By August 2014, when that Hack Reactor ad showed up on my work computer, I had more than a passing familiarity with JavaScript. I wrote it almost daily. I'd used AngularJS for three different projects. And if you'd asked me, I would have told you, yes, I know how to code...</p>
<p>...while a dark, ever-evolving nugget of truth blossomed in the back of my mind, containing my lack of knowledge of closures, compilers, systems, dependency injection, Big-O notation, hash tables, pointers, concurrency, multithreading, inheritance, and everything else that differentiated a computer science prodigy from clueless, fumbling me. There were countless times when I honestly had no idea what I was doing. I flailed around in the darkness, fashioning solutions out of bits and pieces of StackOverflow answers. Programming was like magic to me. I had vague notions of why things worked out in the end -- but only vague, and only notions.</p>
<p>Before you start thinking I've got impostor syndrome, let me bring up <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5">this post</a>, which Hack Reactor recommended. I don't identify with this mindset at all. For one, I actually <em>am</em> an impostor. And second, I actually <em>don't</em> have a background in computer science or anything related to it. Unlike the author, I didn't take programming classes in high school, didn't study CS/CE in college, never cofounded a software startup, and never worked for a tech giant.</p>
<p>Here's my history with computers prior to the age of 23. When I was eleven, I fell in love with the Geocities-era web and taught myself HTML and CSS. But I had no interest in programming whatsoever. In high school, I was convinced that I would be a novelist (that didn't pan out). In college, I was convinced that I would be an architect (that didn't pan out either), and I was the most Luddite architecture major you could imagine. When our professors told us to use Photoshop, I stuck with Microsoft Paint; when I saw my classmates saving time by using the AutoCAD command line, I turned up my nose. I produced hand drawings whenever possible. I put off learning Rhino, the school-sanctioned 3D drawing program, until mere days leading up to my final review. And my 3D renderings were wretched: oddly colored, unrealistic, physically unsound boxes. Needless to say, I had no future as an architect.</p>
<p>When I graduated at 21, I had a strange epiphany that I would make my living off computers. What's even stranger is that it turned out to be true. But I still haven't shaken off the Luddite cloak, which is ultimately why I decided to apply to Hack Reactor.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>After seeing the Smashing Magazine ad, I researched all the programming bootcamps I could find. I immediately ruled out the ones that taught Ruby on Rails (which, by the way, is nearly all of them). Eventually I settled on two: Hack Reactor, my first choice by a long shot, and MakerSquare, as a backup. Hack Reactor appealed to me because of its laser focus on one language, JavaScript, and its intensity.</p>
<p>The MakerSquare interview came first. They stood me up. The admissions coordinator scheduled another interview, but alas, no one showed up to that one, either. How ridiculously unprofessional! So I canceled my application. (The funny part is that Hack Reactor recently acquired MakerSquare.)</p>
<p>When my Hack Reactor interview rolled around, at 10 a.m. on a bleak September Saturday, I was pessimistic. I downloaded Skype onto my computer about half an hour before the interview. The last time I'd used Skype was in 2011 or so, and I'd never used it for video calls. At 9:50, my interviewer messaged me, saying that he would begin the interview soon. Around that time, I checked the calendar confirmation email, and that's when I realized it would be a technical interview.</p>
<p>That's right. I confess to having done zero preparation whatsoever for my Hack Reactor interview. <strong>DO NOT DO THIS.</strong> It was a dreadful mistake on my part, and the only reason I managed to cope with coding in real-time on a Google Doc with zero prep was because I'd been writing JavaScript nearly every day for over a year at that point. I was nervous as hell. Fortunately, my interviewer was really cool. He gave me plenty of hints and encouraged me to talk through my thought process. Thanks to his help, I managed to complete the functions he asked me to write, but I came away feeling like I'd bombed the interview. He told me I would hear back within a week.</p>
<p>Two days later, I got to work, fired up my email, and what did I find? An enrollment agreement and acceptance letter from Hack Reactor. I checked the email headers and freaked out. They'd sent the decision to me within <em>three hours</em> of the end of my interview; I simply hadn't seen it because my application was tied to my GitHub account, which was in turn tied to my work email address.</p>
<p>I wrote back to the HR admission team. I deluged them with questions. I connected with HR alumni on LinkedIn and deluged <em>them</em> with questions. I pushed back my start date from December 8, the cohort I'd applied for, to February 2. I sat on the enrollment agreement for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Then I decided to go.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Hack Reactor used to devote the first two weeks of the course to JavaScript fundamentals. Now they require students to complete a separate precourse curriculum, ensuring that everyone possesses a certain level of JavaScript knowledge before starting the program. I'm under oath not to reveal details about the precourse work, but, as other bloggers have mentioned, it involves cloning a popular functional JavaScript library as well as the front-end of a popular social media site.</p>
<p>My advice for the precourse work? Complete it as soon as possible so you don't have to worry about it. The estimated amount of time is 50-80 hours. I'm pretty sure I completed the precourse work in fewer hours than that, but I also rushed through it to make time for the edX functional programming class I mentioned in my last entry. Looking back, I'm happy I stayed with the functional programming class, as it sharpened my brain and made the precourse work look quite simple by comparison. But I'm not sure I would recommend doing this, especially around the holidays. It was stressful.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Deciding to attend Hack Reactor isn't like deciding to go to college, or deciding to accept a job offer. It's an expensive, unaccredited program, and people will wonder if it's a scam when you tell them about it.</p>
<p>Career-wise, it's probably the most difficult decision I've ever made. To be honest, I'm still not sure it's the right choice, but all I can really do at this point is look forward to the future. I'm beyond excited. Plus, Hack Reactor encourages blogging, so I'll be posting here more frequently!</p>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <div>
<p>Recently I completed Delft University's fall 2014 offering of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x">Introduction to Functional Programming (FP101x)</a> on edX. I've been interested in functional programming for a while (caught the bug when I learned about Python list comprehensions), so I was really excited for this class. It turned out to be one of the better MOOCs I've taken, and definitely the most challenging.</p>
<p>My takeaways from the class:</p>
<div class="section" id="functional-programming-is-cool">
<h2>Functional programming is cool</h2>
<p>Erik Meijer, the professor, is funny and brilliant, and I came away from many of his lectures thinking, wow, that was fascinating. I've read before that learning how to program in a functional style is like learning how to code all over again, which I found to be true. This class opened my mind to a totally different way of reasoning about the structure and composition of programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beginners-beware">
<h2>Beginners, beware</h2>
<p>The prerequisite for FP101x is at least one year of experience programming in an imperative language. I've been working with JavaScript since early 2013, and I learned basic Python and C before that, so you'd think I would be fine. NOPE. Both the homework (multiple choice) and labs (programming assignments) started off simple but got mind-numbingly difficult toward the end. The last two labs in particular really stumped me -- we had to implement Poor Man's Concurrency and rose trees, two subjects that weren't even hinted at in the lectures. And don't even get me started on monads.</p>
<p>I got the sense that Prof. Meijer doesn't typically teach beginners. Based on the assignments and his forum posts, he seemed to have really high expectations of what a MOOC student would be able to accomplish with little guidance and limited time. For me, a total novice, the second half of the class was a struggle. Fortunately, there were plenty of kind, generous folks who took the time to help out their classmates in the forums.</p>
<p>To anyone who's considering taking FP101x: learn a bit about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a> first. Also, <a class="reference external" href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">basic Haskell</a> would be good. The class is language-agnostic, but Prof. Meijer used Haskell in all the lectures and homework assignments. From my travels around the discussion forums I'd wager that most of us ended up solving the labs in Haskell, too, although the instructions were provided in multiple languages (Scala, F#, Groovy, Frege, Ruby). It would have been much easier for me to digest the concepts in this class if I hadn't had to learn an entirely new language as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-speaking-of-haskell">
<h2>But, speaking of Haskell...</h2>
<p>Seriously, what a gorgeous language.</p>
<p>I don't understand it. That is, I understand enough of it to know I don't understand it at all. Regardless, I can still appreciate it on a superficial level.</p>
<p>Say you have a list, and you want to apply one function to the members of the list in odd positions, and another function to the members of the list in even positions. Here's a quick JavaScript implementation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
function oddEvenMap(list, oddFunc, evenFunc) {
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      evenFunc(list[i]);
    } else {
      oddFunc(list[i]);
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>And here it is in Haskell:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
oddEvenMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
oddEvenMap f g [] = []
oddEvenMap f g (x : xs) = f x : oddEvenMap g f xs
</pre>
<p>No variable assignments. No for loops. Haskell is stunningly beautiful and concise. (I realize the comparison to JavaScript isn't fair, but that's the language I know best.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lastly-edx-is-a-great-mooc-platform">
<h2>Lastly, edX is a great MOOC platform</h2>
<p>In 2014, Coursera was my MOOC platform of choice, as I'd finished three classes through it at the end of 2013 (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata">Computing for Data Analysis</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis">Data Analysis</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Machine Learning</a>).</p>
<p>Now edX has taken its place, primarily for usability reasons. Coursera's interface is passable, with many Bootstrappy elements; the videos seem to go on forever. edX's interface is thoughtful and intuitive. Two of my favorite aspects: the video player, which has speed controls and highlighted subtitles that scroll in unison with the instructor's speech, and the homework submission system, which checks each answer individually.</p>
<p>I will definitely be returning to edX for more classes later this year.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="posts/movable-andor-statements.html">Movable AND/OR Statements</a></h2>
      <div class="entry-content">
        <div>
<p>Recently at work I wrote a messy bit of JavaScript (jQuery really) to create movable AND/OR statements. I learned how to code less than a year ago and haven't done any intense programming (yet, just wait), so this is probably the most difficult, headache-inducing, neck-wringing problem I've worked on to date. The last time I encountered this much trouble was when I learned about recursion and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">tries</a>. I figure I'll outline my thought process here in case it's useful to anyone else.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-assignment">
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The goal of these AND/OR statements was to allow users to perform searches with custom parameters. On the right side of the page would be two lists: one containing the available parameters (Location, Category, Subcategory) and the other containing the two operators (AND, OR). On the left two-thirds of the page would be where the user would drag the parameters and operators to build a full search statement.</p>
<p>Full, well-formed search statements would have this format:
<strong>Location OR Category AND Subcategory</strong></p>
<p>Making elements sortable is fairly simple. Two words: <a class="reference external" href="http://jqueryui.com/sortable/">jQuery UI</a>. No, that wasn't the hard part at all. The hard part was following the rules given to me, which involved much tweaking of the sortable interaction and, as always, fighting with the DOM.</p>
<p>The rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Parameters should never be next to parameters, and operators should never be next to operators, e.g., it shouldn't be possible to build statements like <strong>Location Category AND OR Subcategory</strong>.</li>
<li>Operators should never be at the beginning or ending of a statement, e.g., <strong>AND Category AND Subcategory OR</strong>. Pretty much anything that doesn't make sense in natural language shouldn't be possible.</li>
<li>When a parameter or operator (for brevity's sake I'll call them "items" from now on) is dragged from the sidebar into a statement, the sidebar should repopulate with the missing item.</li>
<li>Parameters can be dragged into statements, and operators can be dragged into statements. All other dragging between lists should not be allowed. In other words, a parameter can't be dragged into the list of operators, an operator can't be dragged into the list of parameters, and blocks in statements can't be dragged back into the lists (to be honest, I implemented this last rule to make it slightly easier for me). Also, items can't be dragged from one statement to another.</li>
<li>Since items in statements can't be dragged back into the list, there needs to be a way to clear a statement and start over.</li>
<li>Each statement begins with an empty dotted box, to indicate that a new item can be placed there. As items are placed in the statement, the dotted box should move over to the right until the statement reaches its item limit. The item limit is five, as there are only three parameters and two operators.</li>
<li>Items can be dragged within a statement, but again, parameters should never be next to parameters, and operators should never be next to operators.</li>
<li>Within a statement, if an item is dragged over a like block, it should switch with the like item. In other words, if "Location" is dragged over "Category," the two items should switch places.</li>
<li>When parameters are placed into a statement, they should become editable input boxes, so that the user can enter her preferred location, category, and subcategory.</li>
<li>When a user types into the "Location" input box, this should trigger an autocomplete place search. (I'd been playing with the <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/places/">Google Places API</a> the week prior to this for my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wehoeatmo.com">WeHo Eat Mo</a> project, so this was fairly easy to implement.)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about it. I created some of the rules as I went along based on the issues I faced while interacting with the interface. Bugs just kept on cropping up. (In fact, while writing this, I discovered a few more. Code is never finished.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-else-and-nothing-else">
<h2>If, else, and nothing else</h2>
<p>The code I ended up writing is almost entirely made up of if–else blocks. Here's the nested conditional monster that controls the "sortability" of items (variables are defined at the beginning of the sort):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
function sortRules(event, ui) {
        targetParent = ui.item.parent();
        targetParent.children('.ui-state-dotted').remove();

        // If the to-list is a statement and (1) the from-list is a item list or (2) the to-list and from-list are identical
        // Items can be rearranged within a single statement and dragged from a item list to a statement
        // Items cannot be dragged from one statement to another or from a statement to a item list
        if (targetParent.hasClass('fullStatement') &amp;&amp; (originalParent.hasClass('piece'))) {
                // Add a dotted box (implying that another item can be added) if the total statement length is shorter than five items
                // If the total statement length is equal to five items, don't add another dotted box, but don't cancel the sort, either
                if (targetParent.children('li:not(.delete):not(.ui-state-dotted)').length &lt; 5) {
                        targetParent.append('&lt;li class="ui-state-dotted"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;');
                // Cancel the sort if the statement length has six or more items (including the current item)
                } else if (targetParent.children('li:not(.delete):not(.ui-state-dotted)').length &gt;= 6) {
                        $(this).sortable('cancel');
                }

                // Add a delete button if the statement does not already have it
                if (targetParent.children('.delete').length === 0) {
                        $('&lt;li class="delete"&gt;x&lt;/li&gt;').insertBefore(targetParent.children('li:first-child'));
                }

                // Prevent like items from being placed next to each other
                // i.e., operators should never be next to operators, and parameters should never be next to parameters
                // Check if the item has the same class as the item before it or the item after it
                // or if the item is an operator and (1) the previous item is not a parameter (e.g., operator or undefined),
                // (2) the next item is an operator, and (3) the next item is undefined
                // This prevents operators from being placed next to each other, at the beginning or end of a statement,
                // but allows them to appear before a dotted box
                if ((ui.item.attr('class') === ui.item.prev().attr('class')) || (ui.item.attr('class') === ui.item.next().attr('class')) || (ui.item.hasClass('operator') &amp;&amp; (!ui.item.prev().hasClass('parameter') || ui.item.next().hasClass('operator') || ui.item.next().attr('class') === undefined)) || ui.item.prev().hasClass('ui-state-dotted')) {
                        $(this).sortable('cancel');
                        checkCanceled(targetParent);
                // Otherwise, if the sort arrangement is allowed, continue with the sort
                } else {
                        if (ui.item.hasClass('parameter')) {
                                ui.item.html('&lt;form class="handler"&gt;&lt;input type="text" class="search-input" name="search-input" value=""&gt;&lt;/form&gt;');
                                ui.item.css('padding', '5px');
                        }
                        if (originalText === 'Location') {
                                ui.item.children('form').children('input').attr({
                                        'id': 'locationInput',
                                        'placeholder': 'Enter your city'

                }
        } else if (targetParent.attr('id') === originalParent.attr('id')) {
                // Grab the new target index of the item (after the sort ends)
                newIndex = ui.item.index();
                // Swap the current item with the item at its target index
                // if the target item is an even number away from the current item,
                // so that only like items are swapped with each other
                if (Math.abs(originalIndex - newIndex) % 2 === 0 &amp;&amp; (ui.item.hasClass('operator') &amp;&amp; !ui.item.prev().hasClass('operator'))) {
                        ui.item.next().insertAfter(originalParent.children('li').eq(originalIndex));

                        checkCanceled(targetParent);
                }
        // Prevent items from being dragged from statements back into item lists
        } else {

<p>Yes, this function consists of one if–else block with...I don't even know how many nested if–else blocks inside of each of those conditions. It's terrifying. But it does the trick. Eventually I'd like to refactor this using a hash table, if that's possible.

      <div class="entry-content">
        <div>
<p>Three months ago I decided to start writing consistently.</p>
<p>Since then, I've worked on my novel every single day without fail. In the past, I would have used any sort of negative feeling – laziness, exhaustion, simply "not wanting to write" – as my cue to step back and let writer's block take over, but now I fight through it. All I have to do is start.</p>
<p>Before, I thought of writing every day as some monstrous, impossible feat. But I've found that it's just the opposite. <strong>Writing only when you're inspired is ridiculously hard compared to writing daily.</strong> Inspiration doesn't strike often, and if you rely on it to dictate your writing schedule, then you're not going to write very often. And when you don't practice, you stagnate.</p>
<p>So if you want to write, don't let yourself stagnate. Here are the rules I came up with to jumpstart my writing habit.</p>
<div class="section" id="rule-1-write-a-sentence-every-day">
<h2>RULE #1: Write a sentence every day</h2>
<p>When creating a habit, start small. One sentence is easy to do, and it's a fluid unit: it can be anywhere from one to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_English_sentence">thousands of words</a>. It doesn't even have to be grammatically correct.</p>
<p>In seven days, up your daily number of sentences by one. Repeat for each week that passes. When you've found your ideal number of daily sentences, stop adding to it, and use that number as your permanent minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> This rule helps you to build a writing habit, however small, into your daily schedule. The key is that you don't skip any days. Skipping even one day makes it easier to skip the next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rule-2-don-t-even-think-about-editing">
<h2>RULE#2: Don't even think about editing</h2>
<p>This is extremely important. Unless you're Thomas Pynchon, you will write terrible sentences. And it's okay. That doesn't mean you're a terrible writer – it's just a natural consequence of writing so frequently. Some days your output will be brilliant. Some days you'll look at what you wrote before and want to kill it with fire. But whatever you do, <strong>don't touch any of your previous days' work</strong>.</p>
<p>You're free to edit what you've written today. However, when 24 hours is up, so is your editing access to those sentences. I like to think of work from previous days as being <strong>read-only</strong>.</p>
<p>What if you've written a bunch of sentences in the past few days that don't fit with your new vision of the story? Forget about them! Go forth and write new sentences that do fit with your vision. You can align them when you're done with the entire story.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> One of the fastest ways to kill your writing habit is to get caught in a line-edit loop. I had this problem for many years. I would write something, hate it, and rewrite it ad nauseum until it was "perfect." I couldn't finish my stories because I kept destroying my ideas right after creating them. For more on this topic, read Scott H. Young's excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/01/07/how-to-fuel-a-creative-flow/">How to Fuel a Creative Flow</a>.</p>
<p>This rule helps you to reach the finish line. When you've finished an entire draft – and <em>only</em> when you've finished an entire draft – you can edit to your heart's desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rule-3-begin-where-you-left-off-the-previous-day">
<h2>RULE #3: Begin where you left off the previous day</h2>
<p>Treat your scenes as if they were read-only, too. You can't write a new sentence in the middle of a paragraph from a previous day. If you choose to do this anyway, then that sentence doesn't count.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Rule #2 prevents destructive editing; this rule prevents <em>constructive</em> editing. It ensures that each new sentence is subsequent, which increases the likelihood that the new sentence will push the story forward.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>I've been following these rules for twelve weeks. Today is the first day of week 13, which means I'll write a minimum of 13 sentences every day this week. At this rate, I should have written 546 sentences by now. Instead I've written 34,043 words, which, at an average of 15 words per sentence, translates to about <strong>2270 sentences, over four times what I projected</strong>.</p>
<p>For reference, before I started this habit, the novel clocked in at 49,091 words. It took me well over a year to write that much. Within the past three months, I've written 70% of that amount, and despite my focus on quantity, I've also made strides in quality.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this sentence-based system to anyone who wants to write. For more ideas on how to write every day, check out these articles:</p>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <div>
<p>On Friday, my company held a personal project hack day. I used the opportunity to run a quick-and-dirty experiment based on a question I've had on my mind for months: <strong>What's the most beloved car brand in hip-hop?</strong></p>
<p>In this post, I'll explain how I came up with a possible answer to that question. <a class="reference external" href="http://stephaniehiga.com/cars.html#results">To skip to the results, click here</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-hip-hop-why-cars">
<h2>Why hip-hop / why cars</h2>
<p>Hip-hop is my favorite genre of music. On the road, I tune the radio to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.935kday.com/">93.5 KDAY</a>; otherwise, I'm plugged into my Pandora account, which is heavy on Golden Age, Midwestern, East Coast, Bay Area, and (recently) indie rap. Rap is also lyrically dense, which makes it a great source for text mining.</p>
<p>I got curious about cars because rappers talk about them--a lot. So I decided to find out once and for all which brand they love the most, with <strong>Chevy</strong> (the brand I kept hearing) as my hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-lyrics-mining-process">
<h2>The lyrics mining process</h2>
<p>To find the answer, I needed a sizeable sample of car brand names, a searchable database of hip-hop lyrics, a script to search for the brands within the lyrics database, and a way of displaying the results. Fortunately, all the necessary tools were readily available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python</li>
<li>Wikipedia</li>
<li>LibreOffice Calc</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://research.blackyouthproject.com/raplyrics/">Rap Lyrics Database</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a></li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="gathering-the-data">
<h3>Gathering the data</h3>
<p>Wikipedia blocks web scrapers, understandably. So I manually downloaded all of Wikipedia's lists of car manufacturers and brands by country. To reduce the amount of HTML I would have to parse, I selected the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Mobile View</a> for each page.</p>
<p>I downloaded ten files in total: a general list of car manufacturers plus individual lists for China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cleaning-the-data">
<h3>Cleaning the data</h3>
<p>Wikipedia's Mobile View pages contain search bars at the top and the usual "See also," "References," and "Read in another language" links. I started by erasing these (manually again), reducing the files to structural markup and the lists themselves.</p>
<p>With the Python <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> library, I extracted the brand name tags by selecting all list elements. Then I used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org">NLTK</a> to remove the HTML tags and regular expressions to remove excess whitespace and text (such as notes about the brand, the brand's years of operation, etc.). This is what I came up with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def clean_wikilist(filename):
    # open saved html file
    html = open(filename).read()

    # collect bulleted items only
    bullets = SoupStrainer("li")

    # make soup out of the bulleted items
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml', parse_only = bullets).prettify()

    # remove html from soup
    raw = nltk.clean_html(soup)

    # remove extra lines
    raw = re.sub(r'\n \n \n \n \n', r'\n', raw)
    raw = re.sub(r'\n \n \n', r'\n', raw)

    # create and clean tokens
    tokens = raw.split('\n')
    tokens = [re.sub(r'^\s+(?=[\S]+)', r'', token) for token in tokens]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if not re.findall(r'\[[0-9]+\]|\([\S\s]+[\(\)]?|^\s+$|^[\s\[\]\(\)0-9]+$', token)]
    tokens = list(set(tokens))

    return tokens
</pre>
<p>After running my script on all ten lists, I had a whopping <strong>2599 brand names</strong>. So I decided to limit the set to Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US. The pages for Germany, the UK, and the US separate current brands from defunct brands, so for those countries I used current brands only. The Japan page mixes current and defunct brands into one list; to save time, I used all of them.</p>
<p>These four pages have slightly different structures. The <tt class="docutils literal">clean_wikilist()</tt> script worked nicely for Japan, but captured too much information on the others, so I wrote three additional scripts. Here's the one for Germany:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def autos_ge():
        # open saved html file
        html = open('autos-ge.html').read()

        # create soup object
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html)

        # select current major manufacturers
        majors = soup.select('span.mw-headline')
        majors = [w for w in majors if w.parent.parent.previous_sibling.contents[0]['id'] == 'Current_major_manufacturers']
        major_tokens = [nltk.clean_html(str(w)) for w in majors]
        major_tokens = [re.sub(r'\[\s\S\s\]', r'', token) for token in major_tokens]

        # select current minor manufacturers
        minors = soup.select('li')
        minors = [w for w in minors if w.parent.parent.previous_sibling.contents[0]['id'] == 'Current_minor_manufacturers']
        minor_tokens = [nltk.clean_html(str(w)) for w in minors]
        minor_tokens = [re.sub(r'\s\(\S+\)', r'', token) for token in minor_tokens]

        # combine lists
        tokens = list(set(minor_tokens + major_tokens))

        return tokens
</pre>
<p>One notable difference between this and the original script is the usage of Beautiful Soup. In <tt class="docutils literal">clean_wikilist()</tt>, the desired elements are selected first, with SoupStrainer, and then used to create a list of the matching HTML tags in unicode format. <tt class="docutils literal">autos_ge()</tt>, on the other hand, creates a Beautiful Soup object out of the entire page; the desired elements are selected via DOM traversal.</p>
<p>The number of brand names from this limited dataset? Just 178.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analyzing-the-data">
<h3>Analyzing the data</h3>
<p>The Rap Lyrics Database contains lyrics for all of Billboard Music's rap songs from 1989 through 2009. It's the only searchable database of hip-hop lyrics (exclusively).</p>
<p>The result pages share the same URL, with the search term appended to the end: <em>http://research.blackyouthproject.com/raplyrics/results/?all/1989-2009/</em>. This made it much easier to automate the search and saving process.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def rap_search(auto_list):
    # search for each brand name
    for brand in auto_list:
        url = 'http://research.blackyouthproject.com/raplyrics/results/?all/1989-2009/' + word

        # save the search results page
        results_html = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()

        # save it as a file named after the brand
        results = word + '.html'

        with open(results, 'w') as results_file:
            results_file.write(results_html)
</pre>
<p>This saved 178 HTML pages, each named after the appropriate brand search term, onto my computer. I also searched for known nicknames of the brands (e.g., "Bimmer/Beemer/Beamer" for BMW and "Chevy" for Chevrolet).</p>
<p>I used Beautiful Soup again to count the number of results on each page:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def count_rap_results():
        # for all html files in current directory
        for filename in os.listdir('.'):
        if filename.endswith('html'):

        # select song titles
        html = open(filename).read()
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
        songs = soup.select('.title')

        # count number of song titles
        count = len(songs)

        # write brand names and number of songs into a text file
        with open('count_rap_autos.txt', 'a') as counter_file:
                counter_file.write('%s%15d\n' % (filename[:-5], count))
</pre>
<p>This got me a pretty messy-looking text file of each brand and the number of songs in which it was mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lea-Francis               1</p>
<p>Ewing      0</p>
<p>Efini         0</p>
<p>Scion       0</p>
<p>Tommy Kaira            15</p>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turned out that the Rap Lyrics Database doesn't recognize spaces. So, a search for "Art and Tech" became a search for "Art"--which of course is a popular word that is often used in a non-automobile context. I removed ambiguous names from the list and combined the results from brands and their nicknames. LibreOffice Calc was helpful in fixing the columns and sorting the results.</p>
<p>The final number of usable brands came out to 153.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-won">
<h2>Who won?</h2>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong>, with <strong>93 song mentions</strong>--and remember, that's only counting a small segment of rap songs between 1989-2009.</p>
<p>Jeep came in second, at 34 songs. Then came Cadillac with 25 songs, and finally Chevy at 24.</p>
<p>So, Chevy isn't as popular as I expected. But the biggest shocker is Jeep. I can't recall a single song that mentions Jeep.</p>
<p>To display the results, I made a <a class="reference external" href="http://stephaniehiga.com/cars.html#results">graph</a> with Google Charts. (I'd add them here, but I've yet to learn how to embed JavaScript into reStructuredText.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pain-points">
<h2>Pain points</h2>
<p>I'm new to programming. While I enjoy it very much, I spend about 90% of my time immersed in pain. The text analysis took me four nights (Monday through Thursday) to complete. On the actual hack day, I made the graph and web page, with a lot of help from Bootstrap. Along the way, I encountered many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first">Selecting specific subsets of HTML tags with no classes or ids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Accidentally passing list items with the newline character to the <tt class="docutils literal">rap_search()</tt> script, resulting in 178 filenames split off from their extensions. Fortunately there was an easy fix:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for filename in os.listdir("."):
        if '\n' in filename:
        os.rename(filename, re.sub(r'\n', r'', filename))
</pre>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes-for-the-future">
<h2>Notes for the future</h2>
<div class="section" id="more-complete-data">
<h3>More complete data</h3>
<p>I slashed the set of brand names to less than 7% of its original size and conflated "car manufacturers" with "car brands." Wikipedia also has a lengthy <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobile_marques">list of automobile marques</a>, which I didn't even touch.</p>
<p>I'd like to go deeper than brands, into the actual names of cars, and match them against an even bigger database of lyrics. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rapgenius.com">RapGenius</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm API</a> are possible alternatives to the Rap Lyrics Database. RapGenius has an excellent database, but it contains a significant amount of lyrics from non-hip-hop artists as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="semantic-orientation">
<h3>Semantic orientation</h3>
<p>I equated "beloved" to "number of songs mentions." This is obviously not always the case, as rappers name-drop plenty of things they dislike. It's true that rappers generally mention cars in a positive manner, but a more accurate experiment would take into account not just how many times the brand was used, but in what way the brand was used--i.e., the semantic orientation of the brand. A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a> might be the way to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-word-brands">
<h3>Multi-word brands</h3>
<p>The Rap Lyrics Database turns up blank if you search for, say "Aston Martin" (with the quotes and the space), even though Aston Martin is mentioned in a few songs. So multi-word brands with spaces in them turned up short. (Mercedes-Benz doesn't have this issue because it has a hyphen, not a space.)</p>
<p>If I were to use the Rap Lyrics Database again, I'd have to search for "Aston" and "Martin" separately and compare the songs on each results page. Otherwise, RapGenius seems to do spaces nicely.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nicknames-and-duplicates">
<h3>Nicknames and duplicates</h3>
<p>I searched for "Mercedes-Benz" as well as just "Mercedes" and "Benz." However, again, because I didn't compare song names, I ended up nixing the counts for the nicknames to minimize the possibility of duplicates. I also missed some nicknames--for instance, I completely neglected "Caddy" and "Lac" (sorry, Cadillac), "Lex," etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="misspellings-plurals-etc">
<h3>Misspellings, plurals, etc.</h3>
<p>I did search for "Beamer" and "Beemer," but there's also "Bima" and probably countless other misspellings of "Bimmer" and other car brands. I ignored plurals, whether spelled correctly ("Bimmers") or not ("Bimaz").</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disambiguation">
<h3>Disambiguation</h3>
<p>Many car brands double as common words or unrelated proper names, e.g., Prince, Radical, Ram, MINI, Oakland. I discarded these instead of determining whether or not they were referring to the car brand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="last-thoughts">
<h3>Last thoughts</h3>
<p>A few months ago, when I first got the idea for this project, I thought it would be ridiculously hard. I envisioned building a large corpus of hip-hop lyrics and determining the classification, meaning, and orientation of each word to uncover the truth.</p>
<p>After going about this somewhat backwards, I think my initial impression remains correct. I'm happy I finally took a stab at the project, and I'm excited to continue working on it. This is just the first of a long series of experiments (and blog posts)!</p>

<p>Fire up your command line. Move to the directory containing your version control files (if you're not there already), e.g., <tt class="docutils literal">cd sah</tt>.</p>
<p>Initialize a Git repository in this directory. This is the <strong>local branch</strong>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git init
</pre>
<p>Check the status of your new repository.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git status
</pre>
<p>(or <tt class="docutils literal">git st</tt> if you've set up <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book/ch2-7.html#Git-Aliases">aliases</a>). This is optional, but I like checking the status to see which branch I'm working on and which files will be included in the next commit.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       .doit.db
#       1.txt
#       README.txt
#       cache/
#       conf.py
#       conf.pyc
#       conf.py~

#       stories/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>
<p>Right now there's "nothing added to commit," meaning the local repository is empty. This is because you've just initialized it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="start-tracking-your-files">
<h2>Start tracking your files</h2>
<p>Next, add version control tracking to your files. To add individual files, write <tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt> and then the filename. To add everything in the directory to your commit:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git add .
</pre>
<p>Now it's time to commit the change. The basic commit command is <tt class="docutils literal">git commit</tt>, which will launch your preferred text editor. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></tt> flag allows you to skip the text editor and type your commit message inline; the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></tt> flag tells Git to automatically stage your tracked files, skipping the staging area.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git commit -a -m "Added Nikola site files"
</pre>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">Git Basics - Recording Changes to the Repository</a> for more information on committing changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merge-and-sync-your-branches">
<h2>Merge and sync your branches</h2>
<p>Merge the remote branch (the GitHub copy of the repository) with your local branch (the local copy of the repository). This consolidates the two branches and ensures that they are identical.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git pull https://github.com/sahiga/sah.git
</pre>
<p>You should see a message like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
From https://github.com/sahiga/sah
 * branch            HEAD       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 README.md |    4 ++++

**Note:** ``git pull`` automatically merges commits from the "pulled" branch into your current branch. This works fine on an empty GitHub repository, but it could cause `merge conflicts &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote&gt;`_.
</pre>
<p>Push your commit on the local branch to the remote branch:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git push origin master
</pre>
<p>If you're using HTTPS, GitHub will prompt you for credentials. To switch to SSH, <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/why-is-git-always-asking-for-my-password">follow these instructions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong> I originally attempted <tt class="docutils literal">git push origin master</tt> before <tt class="docutils literal">git pull</tt>, resulting in a "non-fast-forward" error. This error occurs when the local branch is behind the remote branch, and therefore Git can't push the local commits without losing commits on the remote branch. GitHub has an <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-non-fast-forward-errors">article on non-fast-forward errors</a> that I wish I'd found when I made this mistake.</blockquote>
<p>The two branches are now in sync! Check the commit history in your local branch with <tt class="docutils literal">git log</tt>. The most recent commit should have a "Merge" attribute, identical to what you'll find in the "Commits" tab in your GitHub account:</p>

      <div class="entry-content">
        <div>
<p>It's official: I've finally migrated my personal website from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> to <a class="reference external" href="http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar">Nikola</a>, a static site generator. In my 53432099809th attempt to return to writing, I'll use this bit of nerd news to jumpstart what I hope will become a regular blogging habit.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-quest-for-static">
<h2>The quest for static</h2>
<p>WordPress gets a lot of hate in the development community. Let me say upfront that this is absolutely not the reason I decided to leave it (I have the softest of spots for WordPress). It's just that one day I woke up and realized I didn't need a database and a gazillion server queries to post text on my website.</p>
<p>So I started looking into static site generators. A static site generator does exactly what's written on the box: it creates a static site. It combines the best of Web 1.0 (fast, portable, secure HTML pages) with the best of Web 2.0 (templates). I considered:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> + <a class="reference external" href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a>: Hooks directly into <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and is apparently very good. But I don't know Ruby, so I kept looking.</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>: A Python port of Jekyll. Ultimately, I passed on it because of the lack of documentation. When it comes to technology, this Luddite needs a lot of hand-holding.</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com">Pelican</a>: Also Python-based, with complete, well-written documentation. I installed it and got lost while trying to generate files. Pelican looks like a great choice, but I think it's meant for people who are much more tech-savvy than I am.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly after I installed Pelican, someone posted a link to <a class="reference external" href="http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar">Nikola</a> on Hacker News. I'm not sure why it didn't come up in all my searches for Python-based static site generators, because so far it's proven to be a dream come true. The documentation is amazing. It's easy to use and in active development. And it was named after <a class="reference external" href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>. (<strong>Huge</strong> Nikola Tesla fan here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="goodbye-wordpress">
<h2>Goodbye, WordPress</h2>
<p>Nikola has an <tt class="docutils literal">import_wordpress</tt> function to ease the transition to WordPress. I grabbed an XML dump of my site (<strong>Tools &gt; Export &gt; All Content</strong> in the WP admin panel) and saved it in my Nikola site folder.</p>
<p>I installed the Python <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests">requests</a> package (import_wordpress depends on requests):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo pip install requests
</pre>
<p>Then I ran import_wordpress on the file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
nikola import_wordpress stephanieahiga.wordpress.2013-05-05.xml
</pre>
<p>This created a new folder, <strong>new_site</strong>, within the Nikola folder. I had no posts and only a handful of pages in my WordPress database, so I recreated the pages manually using the page command: <tt class="docutils literal">nikola new_post <span class="pre">-p</span></tt>. Similar to WordPress, Nikola differentiates between posts and pages: posts are in the <strong>posts</strong> folder and pages are in the <strong>stories</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Finally, I uninstalled WordPress from my domain via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.simplescripts.com">SimpleScripts</a> on my cPanel.</p>
<p>import_wordpress saves all posts and pages with the <tt class="docutils literal">.wp</tt> extension (read by my computer as WordPerfect files). The XML dump, and therefore the folder created by import_wordpress, save the contents of the WordPress database, but <strong>not</strong> the theme files. So it's important to backup any custom themes before uninstalling WordPress.</p>

<div class="section" id="hello-nikola">
<h2>Hello, Nikola</h2>
<p>I assume that the next step is to upload the Nikola site folder to my domain server. If you're reading this post, you can assume that my assumption turned out to be true.</p>
