Higa</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many months have passed since I graduated from Hack Reactor. Since then, I've undertaken a job search, moved to San Mateo, and started my new job as a software engineer at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kryptnostic.com"&gt;Kryptnostic&lt;/a&gt;, an early-stage startup building secure cloud-based applications. It's been a wonderful ride, and I feel very lucky to be where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is twofold. First up will be my long overdue review of Hack Reactor, and after that I'll share a few of the many lessons I learned while hunting for a job in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="was-hack-reactor-worth-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Was Hack Reactor worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long answer: For me, yes, it turned out to be worth it. What Hack Reactor promises, it delivers. When I speak of promises, I'm referring to the fine print of the student agreement, in which you pay $17,780 in exchange for a crash course in JavaScript plus job search training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both points, Hack Reactor absolutely excels. The software development curriculum is top-notch. I learned so much and so quickly that it felt like I was downloading information into my brain, which was pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Hack Reactor help people to learn so quickly? Different people will give different answers to this question. Some might say the lectures. Others might say the projects. For me, the crucial part of the learning experience was, unquestionably, the opportunity to interact with my remarkable classmates. My cohort was full of kind, brilliant people who encouraged and inspired me to be a better programmer. I learned a ton from working through problems with them, both in my pair programming assignments and in my group projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of my classmates, the 700-plus hours I spent in that concrete tower with the broken elevators at the southeast corner of the Tenderloin were not just tolerable. They were &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often question the hiring statistics on the Hack Reactor website. I don't blame them; it seems ludicrous to suggest that fledgling programmers with no CS background or prior work experience could land six-figure salaries after three months at a for-profit bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm on the other side, it all makes sense. Most Hack Reactor grads end up in the Bay Area, which is flush with tech jobs and where the average going rate for software engineers is on the lower end of six figures. Hack Reactor also expends great effort on crafting and culling their student body. The program selects for students who have already demonstrated a certain level of proficiency in coding and trains those students in strictly practical matters: full-stack JavaScript, MVC frameworks, databases, version control, and those pesky algorithms questions that come up in technical interviews. We did toy problems, whiteboarding sessions, and mock interviews, all of which proved useful during my job search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hack Reactor also trained us to treat job searching as a job in itself, and to take it seriously, but not personally. We were encouraged to apply to five jobs every day and keep up with our toy problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess I did neither of those. But I did apply to 50+ companies total, and there was a memorable two-week period during which I had onsite interviews nearly every day. After a while, I finally understood what people mean when they say job searching is a numbers game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thoughts-on-the-job-search"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on the job search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was more difficult than Hack Reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, I have a terrible aversion to unemployment. I also have bad memories of my previous job search, back in 2010, when I graduated into the recession with a useless degree and no marketable skills. At that time, I did a total of one phone screen and three onsite interviews, all spaced at least a week apart, and immediately took the one and only offer I received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This job search was much, much better. In summary: looking for a job as a front-end engineer in the Bay Area in 2015 was a lot easier than looking for a job as an entry-level sales/marketing/administrative assistant in Los Angeles in 2010, but it was still very difficult. Some of the things I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="you-re-interviewing-the-company-as-much-as-the-company-is-interviewing-you"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You're interviewing the company as much as the company is interviewing you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both you and the company are evaluating each other to see whether there's a good fit. I was looking for companies that showed interest in me beyond my ability to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, I could always tell within the first five minutes how the interview would turn out. Some interviewers started by asking about my background, which made me more interested in those companies. Others started by asking me programming questions, which indicated to me that they didn't really care who I was as long as I could code, and those interviews quickly went south. There were no surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="soft-skills-are-just-as-important-as-technical-skills"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Soft skills are just as important as technical skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical interview process is more than just &lt;em&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/em&gt;. Being able to build rapport with an interviewer is critical. Interviewers want to see that you're someone they can get along with and would want to work with. And some companies, particularly startups, place an even higher premium on soft skills than on technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveat: possible confirmation bias. Maybe I just happened to fail all the interviews that were 100% technical. I also only applied for front-end positions, which generally have an easier (for me) interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="narratives-matter"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Narratives matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a long time crafting my narrative. Four and a half years to be exact. Remember that one offer I received in 2010? It was for a business development internship paying fifty cents above minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays when I tell people that, they reel in shock. Minimum wage! Well, sure, why not? I wasn't entitled to anything. Back then, my narrative was weak. Practically nonexistent. I was a fresh college graduate with no real work experience, who had decided, in a mystifying twist, not to pursue a career in the field she'd spent four years studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I just needed to start working as soon as possible. So I took the offer, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. That company gave me so many opportunities to be so many different people: a salesperson, an administrative assistant, a receptionist, a marketer, a customer service representative, an account manager, an internship program coordinator, a copywriter, a designer, and finally, a front-end developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a strong narrative inside of them; it's just a matter of storytelling. Frame your background in a way that helps employers to see that the next logical step in your narrative would be working for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="job-search-support-is-essential"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Job search support is essential&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for a job is a degrading and stressful experience. Mine would have been much worse if it weren't for the support of my friends at Hack Reactor. During the first couple of weeks of my search, I complained to a friend that while I'd had a bunch of phone screens and remote technical interviews, I hadn't yet had any onsites. He told me to stop whining and start actively applying for jobs on AngelList. It was the best advice I received during the process. Following that advice led to a flurry of onsites, which in turn yielded good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="angellist-is-awesome"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AngelList is awesome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AngelList introduced me to a ton of interesting startups, including the one I ended up joining. If you're on the hunt for a software job, make sure you've created a candidate profile and set it to &lt;strong&gt;actively looking&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="failing-an-interview-is-not-the-end-of-the-world"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Failing an interview is not the end of the world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews I failed prepared me for the interviews I didn't fail. After a while, I became quite comfortable with rejection. In fact, one day I reached out to so many companies on AngelList that I ended up getting rejection letters from companies I didn't even remember applying to. Some of those companies are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; sending me rejection letters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejection can be personal, but it's best not to take it personally. As I mentioned above, interviewing is a mutual process. Companies reject candidates for all sorts of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="employers-will-read-your-blog"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Employers will read your blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(very meta, I know)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple employers referenced specific posts on my blog during my interviews. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.stephaniehiga.com/posts/degrees-of-pynchon.html"&gt;Degrees of Pynchon&lt;/a&gt; post came up most often, followed by the one on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.stephaniehiga.com/posts/off-to-hack-reactor.html"&gt;my decision to go to Hack Reactor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.stephaniehiga.com/posts/review-introduction-to-functional-programming.html"&gt;my review of the functional programming class I took last year&lt;/a&gt;. I only wish I'd taken the time to post about the three group projects I did at Hack Reactor. I still have a lot to say about those projects, so maybe I'll write about them soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="being-different-can-be-a-good-thing"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Being different can be a good thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereotypical -- and some might say "ideal" -- software engineer is male and holds a degree in computer science from a top engineering school. I'm a woman who didn't learn to code until long after college, and I was fully prepared to be discriminated against during the job search for these reasons. But I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I've lamented what I studied in college (architecture), which continually tops lists of majors with the highest unemployment rate. In 2010, it was difficult to prove in interviews that I could work hard and excel at jobs that had nothing to do with my major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture came up much less frequently during my last job search. Most Hack Reactor grads have an unusual trajectory, so no one expected me to have a CS degree. I'm also five years out of college, so my work experience has finally trumped where I went to school and what I studied. During my interviews, an interesting pattern emerged: not only did employers not mind my lack of a CS degree; some of them &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; the fact that I'd studied architecture and even reached out to me because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, possible caveat: front-end engineers are often expected to have design skills, or at least an appreciation for design. I assume employers would prefer to hire CS majors for backend positions if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my former housemates asked me if I felt employers discriminated me in the job search because I'm a woman. I'm happy to say that the answer is, on the whole, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;. If anything, I suspect the scales were tipped slightly in my favor because of my gender. Female software engineers are still unfortunately rare, so I imagine it was easier for employers to remember me. (I'll refrain from further speculation, as it would feed into my impostor syndrome to believe that employers deliberately recruited me to fill diversity quotas, or that they held me to a lower technical standard than they did for male candidates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="but-wait-there-s-more"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But wait, there's more!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the bulk of this post in June 2015, right after I started my new job. I still stand by everything I wrote above, but with one clarification. I realize I may have given the impression that being a smooth talker and keeping a blog will make up for a lack of technical ability, which is &lt;em&gt;absolutely not true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past few months, I've switched over to the other side of the technical interview process. While evaluating 20+ candidates for front-end positions at my company, I've found that the most successful candidates possess strong technical skills as well as strong soft skills. (Big surprise there!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>hack reactor</category><category>hiring</category><guid>http://www.stephaniehiga.com/posts/a-tale-of-two-silicon-valley-experiences.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 02:05:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Degrees of Pynchon</title><link>http://www.stephaniehiga.com/posts/degrees-of-pynchon.html</link><dc:creator>Stephanie A. Higa</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent two days last week working on solo projects at Hack Reactor. I built a visualization of literary influences, beginning with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thomaspynchon.com/"&gt;Thomas Pynchon&lt;/a&gt; -- who, aside from being totally amazing, a genius, and one of my personal role models, also has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon#Influence"&gt;lengthy section on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; full of writers who influenced him and writers he's influenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thomas-pynchon-s-circle-of-influence"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thomas Pynchon's circle of influence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize the relationships between Pynchon and the writers connected to him, I created an arc diagram  in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.d3js.org"&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, I planned on using D3's built-in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Chord-Layout"&gt;chord layout&lt;/a&gt; generator, but I fell in love with arc diagrams after seeing so many beautiful examples online (e.g., &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Visualizations/BibleViz"&gt;Bible Cross-References&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.autodeskresearch.com/pages/infovis/command_usage_arc"&gt;Command Usage Arc Diagrams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.turbulence.org/Works/song/gallery/gallery.html"&gt;The Shape of Song&lt;/a&gt;, among others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went down a few rabbit holes, including creating a matrix dataset similar to those required by the chord layout and plotting the writers as nodes on a scale. Thankfully, there's this wonderful &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bl.ocks.org/sjengle/5431779"&gt;Les Misérables character co-ocurrences arc diagram&lt;/a&gt;, also in D3, which set me on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I formatted the influence data into an object with two arrays, &lt;strong&gt;nodes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;links&lt;/strong&gt;. Each node contains the name of a writer and a number indicating the writer's category (influencer or influencee), and each link contains a connection between Thomas Pynchon and another writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://sahiga.github.io/degrees-of-pynchon"&gt;&lt;img alt="Thomas Pynchon's literary influences" src="http://www.stephaniehiga.com/images/degrees-of-pynchon.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Click for the interactive version. I stole the quote from the Simpsons episode in which Thomas Pynchon reviews Marge's book. For anyone unfamiliar with Pynchon: he does not love cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the influencers appear to the left of Pynchon, with an arc above the horizontal; all the influencees appear to the right, with an arc below the horizontal. The colors were generated by D3's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Ordinal-Scales#category20b"&gt;category20b scale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-circles-of-influence"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other circles of influence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to visualize the influences of the other writers. Initially, I added all their connections to Pynchon's graph. This worked for Vladimir Nabokov but failed for Emily Dickinson, who was influenced by a writer who appeared to the right of her (Ralph Waldo Emerson) -- resulting in a backwards connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was to create new graphs and layer them on top of Pynchon's. So, clicking on Nabokov's name (for instance) will fade out Pynchon's graph, increase the size of Nabokov's name, move his name and dot to the center of the page, draw a line from his name to the center dot, and display his influence graph around that new center. Mousing away from Nabokov's graph will delete his graph and bring back Pynchon's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Vladimir Nabokov's literary influences" src="http://www.stephaniehiga.com/images/degrees-of-pynchon-new-graph.png"&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Vladimir Nabokov's literary influences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to rearrange the new graph around the new center dot was probably the most difficult part of the entire project. I passed the center position to the new graph and gave the influencer dots a negative x-axis position so that they appeared to the left of the center dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hover-selections"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hover selections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last feature I added was a hover selection event. Mousing over a writer's name will fade out the entire diagram except for the name, dot, and arc belonging to that writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hovering over William S. Burroughs" src="http://www.stephaniehiga.com/images/degrees-of-pynchon-hover.png"&gt;&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Hovering over William S. Burroughs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the second most difficult part of the project, because of the preexisting fade effects associated with the click event. The entire graph fades out upon clicking a name, and the entire graph fades back in when the mouse leaves the new graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up initializing a boolean to keep everything in check: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;multipleGraphsOnPage&lt;/tt&gt; starts off as false, becomes true when a new graph is created, and reverts to false when the new graph is deleted. The hover selection event is enabled only when &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;multipleGraphsOnPage&lt;/tt&gt; is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-project-completion-strategy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My project completion strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the solo project was not to build a perfect product, but a minimum viable product. Hack Reactor instructed us to reduce the size of our scope in half, twice -- which I didn't even need to do, since I'd deliberately chosen a very small scope to begin with. The extra time afforded me the chance to polish the look and feel of my project, including the animations, and dive deeper into D3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was really fun. D3 is by far my favorite JavaScript library ever, and I can't wait to make more visualizations with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-d3-svg-resources"&gt;

Higa</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackreactor.com"&gt;Hack Reactor&lt;/a&gt; next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hack Reactor is a programming bootcamp -- the most intense of its kind, at eleven hours a day, six days a week, for twelve weeks. Pretty much everyone I've mentioned it to has recoiled in horror, imagining what it would be like to spend so much time cooped up in front of a screen. Yeah, I know. It sounds terrible. It might even sound nonsensical. But here I am anyway: packing my bags, preparing to fly to San Francisco in a few days, and writing about the program that will take over my life for the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last August I happened upon A List Apart during work hours, likely in search of CSS help. I'm sure I found what I was looking for, but what caught my eye was an ad for Hack Reactor. Twelve-week immersive programming bootcamp! Six-figure average starting salary! It seemed too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only programming bootcamp I'd heard of was General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, which had briefly interested me until I lucked into a front-end development role at my company back in 2013. I'd even taken a couple of General Assembly classes -- Intro to Data Science and Analysis (at their Santa Monica campus) and Optimizing Landing Pages for Conversion (online) -- neither of which had impressed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hack Reactor looked like a completely different species of bootcamp. It looked like something I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have questioned why I would need a bootcamp when I already have a career in web development. So I feel compelled to explain my reasoning here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may not be a novice programmer, but I learned to code recently enough that I remember what it was like to be a novice programmer and how much I struggled to even get to that point. I'm a late bloomer: after years of grappling with for loops and other basic concepts, I finally managed to make sense of programming at the ripe old age of 23. (In fact, I was weeks, maybe even days, away from 24 at that point.) The book that did it for me is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/book/"&gt;Natural Language Processing with Python&lt;/a&gt; -- a truly wonderful read, if you're more inclined to language than math, as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to code was a terrific, frustrating, enlightening experience. When I realized I could solve problems in Python, I was shocked. People had told me that it was impossible to learn to code after a certain age, that developers had an "innate ability" that I didn't have. (By the way, if anyone ever says such complete and utter bullshit to you, you must prove them wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after I taught myself basic Python, I offered to build a WordPress theme for a project at work, through which I picked up jQuery and a tiny bit of PHP. Within half a year, the company decided to move me from the business team to the development team; from there, I learned a ton on the job and eventually served as the sole front-end developer and designer. By August 2014, when that Hack Reactor ad showed up on my work computer, I had more than a passing familiarity with JavaScript. I wrote it almost daily. I'd used AngularJS for three different projects. And if you'd asked me, I would have told you, yes, I know how to code...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...while a dark, ever-evolving nugget of truth blossomed in the back of my mind, containing my lack of knowledge of closures, compilers, systems, dependency injection, Big-O notation, hash tables, pointers, concurrency, multithreading, inheritance, and everything else that differentiated a computer science prodigy from clueless, fumbling me. There were countless times when I honestly had no idea what I was doing. I flailed around in the darkness, fashioning solutions out of bits and pieces of StackOverflow answers. Programming was like magic to me. I had vague notions of why things worked out in the end -- but only vague, and only notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start thinking I've got impostor syndrome, let me bring up &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, which Hack Reactor recommended. I don't identify with this mindset at all. For one, I actually &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; an impostor. And second, I actually &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have a background in computer science or anything related to it. Unlike the author, I didn't take programming classes in high school, didn't study CS/CE in college, never cofounded a software startup, and never worked for a tech giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my history with computers prior to the age of 23. When I was eleven, I fell in love with the Geocities-era web and taught myself HTML and CSS. But I had no interest in programming whatsoever. In high school, I was convinced that I would be a novelist (that didn't pan out). In college, I was convinced that I would be an architect (that didn't pan out either), and I was the most Luddite architecture major you could imagine. When our professors told us to use Photoshop, I stuck with Microsoft Paint; when I saw my classmates saving time by using the AutoCAD command line, I turned up my nose. I produced hand drawings whenever possible. I put off learning Rhino, the school-sanctioned 3D drawing program, until mere days leading up to my final review. And my 3D renderings were wretched: oddly colored, unrealistic, physically unsound boxes. Needless to say, I had no future as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I graduated at 21, I had a strange epiphany that I would make my living off computers. What's even stranger is that it turned out to be true. But I still haven't shaken off the Luddite cloak, which is ultimately why I decided to apply to Hack Reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing the Smashing Magazine ad, I researched all the programming bootcamps I could find. I immediately ruled out the ones that taught Ruby on Rails (which, by the way, is nearly all of them). Eventually I settled on two: Hack Reactor, my first choice by a long shot, and MakerSquare, as a backup. Hack Reactor appealed to me because of its laser focus on one language, JavaScript, and its intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MakerSquare interview came first. They stood me up. The admissions coordinator scheduled another interview, but alas, no one showed up to that one, either. How ridiculously unprofessional! So I canceled my application. (The funny part is that Hack Reactor recently acquired MakerSquare.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my Hack Reactor interview rolled around, at 10 a.m. on a bleak September Saturday, I was pessimistic. I downloaded Skype onto my computer about half an hour before the interview. The last time I'd used Skype was in 2011 or so, and I'd never used it for video calls. At 9:50, my interviewer messaged me, saying that he would begin the interview soon. Around that time, I checked the calendar confirmation email, and that's when I realized it would be a technical interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. I confess to having done zero preparation whatsoever for my Hack Reactor interview. &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT DO THIS.&lt;/strong&gt; It was a dreadful mistake on my part, and the only reason I managed to cope with coding in real-time on a Google Doc with zero prep was because I'd been writing JavaScript nearly every day for over a year at that point. I was nervous as hell. Fortunately, my interviewer was really cool. He gave me plenty of hints and encouraged me to talk through my thought process. Thanks to his help, I managed to complete the functions he asked me to write, but I came away feeling like I'd bombed the interview. He told me I would hear back within a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, I got to work, fired up my email, and what did I find? An enrollment agreement and acceptance letter from Hack Reactor. I checked the email headers and freaked out. They'd sent the decision to me within &lt;em&gt;three hours&lt;/em&gt; of the end of my interview; I simply hadn't seen it because my application was tied to my GitHub account, which was in turn tied to my work email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote back to the HR admission team. I deluged them with questions. I connected with HR alumni on LinkedIn and deluged &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; with questions. I pushed back my start date from December 8, the cohort I'd applied for, to February 2. I sat on the enrollment agreement for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hack Reactor used to devote the first two weeks of the course to JavaScript fundamentals. Now they require students to complete a separate precourse curriculum, ensuring that everyone possesses a certain level of JavaScript knowledge before starting the program. I'm under oath not to reveal details about the precourse work, but, as other bloggers have mentioned, it involves cloning a popular functional JavaScript library as well as the front-end of a popular social media site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice for the precourse work? Complete it as soon as possible so you don't have to worry about it. The estimated amount of time is 50-80 hours. I'm pretty sure I completed the precourse work in fewer hours than that, but I also rushed through it to make time for the edX functional programming class I mentioned in my last entry. Looking back, I'm happy I stayed with the functional programming class, as it sharpened my brain and made the precourse work look quite simple by comparison. But I'm not sure I would recommend doing this, especially around the holidays. It was stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding to attend Hack Reactor isn't like deciding to go to college, or deciding to accept a job offer. It's an expensive, unaccredited program, and people will wonder if it's a scam when you tell them about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career-wise, it's probably the most difficult decision I've ever made. To be honest, I'm still not sure it's the right choice, but all I can really do at this point is look forward to the future. I'm beyond excited. Plus, Hack Reactor encourages blogging, so I'll be posting here more frequently!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>hack reactor</category><category>programming</category><guid>http://www.stephaniehiga.com/posts/off-to-hack-reactor.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 23:45:45 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
