Objected is a gallery documenting inanimate object torture.



Inanimate objects are easy targets because they do not show feelings as animals do. We can destroy them without suffering guilt afterward. We destroy them without even knowing. We might even think them the natural slaves of the animate that created them. Even when we don’t try, we force them into subjection.



This project does not chronicle everyday accidents. No. The objects in these photos have all been tortured on purpose. Maliciously. Without regard for their dignity and original form.



This is a gallery of damages.



<h2><a href="#">Shadestoppers</a> (under construction)</h2>

I make sculptures from leftover objects sitting around my house. All these sculptures vaguely resemble glasses (wearable kind) and are built with glue guns and X-acto blades — no drilling, cutting, or welding machines. This is because I am cheap and afraid of sharp moving things.



I also make virtual glasses in 3D modeling programs.</body></html>
