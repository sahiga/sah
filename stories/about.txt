Hello! I'm a writer and web developer based in Los Angeles, California.

I currently work at a mobile technology incubator-accelerator on the Sunset Strip.

In my spare time, I wrangle text, symbols, and pictures.

Samuel R. Delany's `Dhalgren <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhalgren>`_ is my favorite novel, followed closely by `V. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.>`_ and `Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World>`_.
