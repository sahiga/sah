Hello! I'm Stephanie, a writer and web developer based in Los Angeles, California.

Samuel R. Delany's `Dhalgren <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhalgren>`_ is my favorite novel, followed closely by `V. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.>`_ and `Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World>`_.

About the blog
==============

For now, this is my technical learning blog. I'm currently tackling several technologies for work or for play--Python (mainly natural language processing techniques with NLTK), JavaScript + jQuery, Git, Bash, Haml + Sass (integrating with Rails), Parse Cloud Code + Express JS--and the sheer volume of information available is overwhelming. Writing about what I've learned helps me to track my progress, identify areas of improvement, and provide an easy-to-find reference if I ever encounter the same issues in the future.
