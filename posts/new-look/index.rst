It's been so long (2+ years) since I updated this site that I literally forgot everything. I had to reinstall Python3 and recreate my Nikola virtual environment.

In other news, I have a `new art site <http://www.stephaniehiga.art>`_ that may or may not get updated more frequently than this site. That's right. I'm an artist now! No more coding! 🙅🏻‍♀️👩🏻‍💻 → 👩🏻‍🎨🎨  (jk, I totally still write something resembling JavaScript every day)
