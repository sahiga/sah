As you can see, I got my site up and running. It turned out that I only needed to upload a few files to my **public_html** folder, not the whole Nikola site folder (obvious in retrospect):

- The posts folder
- The pages folder
- The categories folder
- The assets folder of folders (CSS, JS, images)
- index.html
- archive.html
- rss.xml

Next, I wanted to use `GitHub <https://wwww.github.com>`_ to manage my code.
